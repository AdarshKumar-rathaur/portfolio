                <p>
                    Hi! I'm <strong>Adarsh Singh</strong>, a passionate and curious Computer Science student at <strong>ABES Engineering College, Ghaziabad</strong>.
                    I specialize in <strong>front-end web development</strong> and enjoy turning ideas into real-world applications using
                    <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, and <code>React</code>. I'm constantly exploring new technologies
                    and love building projects that solve real problems or showcase creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently in my first year, I’ve already started building projects like a <strong>Library Manager</strong> and a
                    <strong>Tech Daily</strong> news app using APIs — and I’m just getting started!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to grow into a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> who not only writes clean, efficient code but also
                    designs intuitive user experiences. I believe in <em>learning by doing</em>, and I'm always open to collaborating on
                    exciting ideas, internships, or freelance opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech trends, working on logic-building exercises,
                    or helping peers debug their code.
                </p>
